# BdelloSim

The goal of BdelloSim is to simulate growth of *Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus* in various hosts. Simulations is based upon average
number of progeny cells and *B. bacteriovorus* life cycle length in the
host calculated from microscopy observations. Starting number of host
and *B. bacteriovorus* cells can be chosen.

We assume that always all *B. bacteriovorus* find a host (if enough host
cells are available) and that the host does not replicate during
simulation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BdelloSim like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('astrzalka/BdelloSim')
```
