# BdelloSim

The goal of BdelloSim is to simulate growth of *Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus* in various hosts. 
Simulations is based upon average number of progeny cells and *B. bacteriovorus* life cycle length in the host calculated from microscopy observations. Starting number of host and *B. bacteriovorus* cells can be chosen.

We assume that always all *B. bacteriovorus* find a host (if enough host cells are available) and that the host does not replicate during simulation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BdelloSim like so:

```{r}
devtools::install_github('astrzalka/BdelloSim')
```
